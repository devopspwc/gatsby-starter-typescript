This is an example of how you can build your site around Markdown files.

Images referenced in Markdown are copied to the generated site, like this pic:

Finally, here's some sample code with beautiful syntax highlighting thanks to PrismJS:

```typescript
function greeting(name: string): string {
  return 'Hello, ' + name + '!'
}

console.log(greeting('GatsbyJS'))
```

Go back to the [content index](/all).
